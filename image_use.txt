Hi there Brian,

Thanks for reaching out to me regarding this. I'll bet you can imagine the amount of people who would just see this image on line and just use it without even a thought regarding the original artist. So I appreciate that you have done that. If all you want to do is use this render, and you're a non-profit, I have no problem with you using it for free. All I'd ask in return is a credit somewhere on your software that I'm the creator of the image. An artist credit will be fine.

Good luck with your project.



Regards,
